# 🧮 Population Density Analysis

A data exploration project focusing on population statistics, regional demographics, and density metrics in South Korea.

## 📂 Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a CSV dataset containing population and geographic information by administrative regions. It performs:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature renaming from Korean to English
- Basic EDA (exploratory data analysis)

## 📊 Features

- Cleans and standardizes Korean population data
- Handles missing values with forward fill
- Renames columns for easier readability
- Prepares data for density calculations and visualizations (coming soon!)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is expected to be uploaded manually via Google Colab.

> **Note**: Encoding is assumed to be `euc-kr`, which is standard for Korean datasets. Make sure your file is encoded properly or adjust accordingly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload your dataset when prompted.
3. Run all cells to clean and explore your data.

## 💡 Planned Improvements

- Add population density calculation (`Population / Area_km2`)
- Visualize density distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Create choropleth maps (with GeoPandas or Folium)
- Add regression analysis between demographic variables
